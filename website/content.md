Promode Agro Farm,Bio Dynamic Farming at best ensuring
1. Organic Equivalent at Normal Price!" 
2. Missing your state? your Bengali Food @doorstep.

We are applying biodynamic farming methods to help Bengali migrants in Hyderabad to access foods of their origin while making organic foods more affordable.

Nestled in the heart of Yadgirigutta, our farm is a testament to nature's bounty and the hard work of our dedicated team.

Promode Agro Farms was founded in 2021 by group of visionaries with a deep love for the land and a commitment to sustainable agriculture.We started this farming for our own needs for two reasons:

1. We knew health benefits of Organic Foods but it was much costly to afford.
2. We missed our Bengali Food in Hyderabad so wanted to frow here

What began as a small family venture has grown into a thriving farm that embraces modern Bio Dynamic farminng techniques while staying true to traditional values. Over the years, we have expanded our operations and enhanced our practices to ensure that we deliver fresh, healthy, and environmentally-friendly products to our customers.
